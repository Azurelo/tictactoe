# Tic Tac Toe C# Overview

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using C# and Windows Forms in Visual Studio. 

The purpose of creating this software is to deepen my understanding of the C# language and to gain experience building graphical user interface (GUI) applications. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O" until one player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw. This project helped me explore the concepts of event-driven programming, GUI components, and game logic in C#.
